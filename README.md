## About the game
* The guy runs forward
* When he hits an obstacle with his face the game is over
* You can jump over obstacles (the longer you hold the jump button, the higher character jumps)
* You can shoot various targets with your bow (bow targets, birds, chickens, your own arrows in mid-air)
* Every 1000 meters you speed up
* You can pick up bonuses (additional arrows, slow down, bonus points, etc.)

### Tips
* Turn off the music, it is annoying
* Turn off sounds if the game lags
* You can aim your bow by dragging a finger at empty space (mouse on PC)
  * Press on empty area (basically anywhere that is not the jump button) and hold your finger
  * Drag your finger in the opposite direction from where you want to shoot
  * Release your finger to shoot an arrow
* You can jump with the Spacebar on PC
* Tree stumps actually __are not__ obstacles, although look like ones (my bad)
* Wells in villages actually __are__ obstacles

## Download
You can download apk file [here](https://github.com/SerGreen/BowRunner/releases/latest) (it is unsigned though).  
I did not bother making Windows executable. You can launch it via Android Studio.

### How to launch on desktop
In order for it to work on PC, you have to set Working directory in Run configurations to "~\BowRunner\android\assets", otherwise it will not be able to find any asset and will crash at start.
