## About the game
* The guy runs forward
* If he'll hit an obstacle with his face => Game Over
* You can jump over obstacles (the longer you hold the jump button, the higher character jumps)
* You can shoot different targets with your bow (bow targets, birds, chickens, your own arrows in mid-air)
* Every 1000 meters you speed up
* You can pick up bonuses (additional arrows, slow down, bonus points, etc.)

### Tips
* Turn off music, it is annoying
* Turn off sounds if the game lags
* You can aim your bow with a second finger (or mouse on PC)
 * Press on empty area (basically anywhere that is not the jump button) and hold your finger
 * Drag your finger in opposite direction from where you want to shoot
 * Release your finger to shoot an arrow
* You can jump with Spacebar on PC
* Tree stumps actually __are not__ obstacles, although look like ones
* Wells in villages actually __are__ obstacles

Some assets are not made by me (because i draw like a retard) i found them on the internet. Consider them programmer art. I do not know who are the real authors and i'm not sure if they are free or not, but i do not monetize my app, so i consider this a fair use.
